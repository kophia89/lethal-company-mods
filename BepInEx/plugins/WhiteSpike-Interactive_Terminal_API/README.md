# InteractiveTerminalAPI
An API which focuses on making terminal applications where the player can interact with besides inputting text to it

# Features
- Classes/interfaces where you can use to build your own terminal application
	- You can also make your own custom classes that derive from these to be used as replacements
- Executes the application associated with a given text prompt entered in the terminal (if registered).

# Important notices
- The mod itself doesn't do anything. It's just an API which other mod developers may wish to use for their own usages.
- It won't alter any vanilla terminal text on its own.

# Documentation
- For the developers interested in using this, take your time at [reading some stuff about it](https://github.com/WhiteSpike/InteractiveTerminalAPI/wiki/Classes).
