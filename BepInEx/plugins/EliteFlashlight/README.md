# Lethal Company Elite-flashlight

This mod adds a third tier of flashlight, the Elite-flashlight! Only the best of the best use this new flashlight! Make sure your crew doesn't get jealous of you...

The Elite-flashlight has a longer and wider light compared to the Pro-flashlight, weighs 6 lbs, and has an 8 minute battery life, compared to the Pro's 5 minutes. The flashlight costs 50 credits (can be configured) in the store.

Works out of the box with [Flashlight slot](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedFlashlightSlot/)!

NOTE: The new bulb at the front of the flashlight added in 1.0.1 for some reasons doesn't switch correctly and has some weirdness with some mods installed. Mod's I've ran into that cause it to mess up are LethalSettings and GeneralImprovements. I don't know why this happens, but it doesn't cause anything other than the bulb not switching on the model. It has no impact on the game other than that.

# Screenshots
Here's some comparisons between the Pro's and the Elite-flashlight's lights.
