- Makes the Item Dropship arrive and leave faster.
- The Item Dropship will arrive within 10 seconds of buying items, and will depart after 3 seconds of opening the dropship doors, or after 40 seconds, whichever is sooner.
- Items purchased while a delivery is in progress, but before the Item Dropship has fully landed, will be added immediately so you don't have to wait for the next one.
- All settings can now be edited in the config!
- Sanic not included.
